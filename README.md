# sphinx-contrib GitHub Administration

This repository is used for managing the sphinx-contrib GitHub organization, including requesting importing new repositories or granting permissions.

## How do I add a new repo to sphinx-contrib?

1. Create the repository elsewhere, such as under your personal account.
2. File a ticket [here](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/github-administration/issues) asking to join the organization.
3. Accept the invitation to join.
4. An organization admin will request administrative rights on the repository being moved. This is required in order to move the repository. See [the GitHub documentation on repository transfer](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/transferring-a-repository) for details.
5. After permission is granted, an admin will move the repository into the org.
6. After it is moved, an admin will rename the repository to remove prefixes like `sphinx`, `sphinx-contrib`, and `sphinxcontrib`. Updating documentation in the repository is left up to the owner.
